								<h1>End of support for <strong>Lively</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p><strong style="color:white">Hey all! Hope everyone is good!</strong> <br> Unfortunetly me and untab have some bad news. As some of you already know Lively was denied for verification a while back. This was because of inorganic growth which we aren't aware of, and we have told Discord this over a month ago and have gotten no response. This means that if Lively gets into 100 servers it will be locked at that and not able to enter new ones. This of course we cannot have as it means the bot is kind of pointless. Therefore we have decided to end support and hosting of Lively on the <strong style="color:white"> 29th of this month (July 2021). </strong>
								<br> Although we have got some good news and a new announcement! Introducing <strong style="color:white">Team Lively! </strong> (Which is the site you are on right now). This is what untab and I will be working on for the forseeable future. What is Team Lively you may ask? Well it is a <strong style="color:white"> development  team </strong>where we plan to develop and run many types of things including but not limited to Discord Bots. We already have a couple of them in mind, maybe even one that will replace and be even better than Lively. We also have some brand new things we are very excited to release. For more info on Team Lively check out our Website https://teamlively.pogr.cc/ and for updates quicker than everyone else and if you have any questions etc, join our Discord Server! https://discord.pogr.cc/
								We hope to see you there for maybe one day, a new better Lively. <br> untab and I will always remember Lively as our first major coding project, we have learned lots from this and made plenty of mistakes. 
								<br> Thank you everyone for supporting us and Lively in the past year, hopefully we will see you over at Team Lively.
								<br> <strong style="color:white"> To Lively, Goodbye o7 </strong> </p>
